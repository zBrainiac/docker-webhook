With [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site), you instantly get a unique, random URL that you can use to test and debug Webhooks and HTTP requests, as well as to create your own workflows using the Custom Actions graphical editor or WebhookScript, a simple scripting language, to transform, validate and process HTTP requests.

## What are people using it for?

* Receive Webhooks without needing an internet-facing Web server
* Send Webhooks to a server that’s behind a firewall or private subnet
* Transforming Webhooks into other formats, and re-sending them to different systems
* Connect different APIs that aren’t compatible
* Building contact forms that send emails
* Instantly build APIs without needing infrastructure

## Open Source

There are two versions of Webhook.site:

* The completely open-source, MIT-licensed version is available on Github, which can be self-hosted using e.g. Docker, is great for testing Webhooks, but doesn’t include features like Custom Actions.

* The cloud version at [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site) which has more features, some of them requiring a paid subscription.
